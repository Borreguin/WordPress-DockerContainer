# :sunglasses: WordPress + React Native + Django Project

In recent years I have participated in different projects with different technologies and I wondered what if I try to
use the best of each of them to see if I can carry out scalable projects in this way? So my expectation is that I would
like the platform not to depend too much on the programmer and also to give the user some freedom to create content. So,
I came up with the idea of using a web content management system so that the client can add additional content and, in
cases where complicated user interfaces are needed, use a Javascript framework that can take advantage of its benefits
and, finally, be able to solve cases when there is need for powerful data analysis framework like Python.

So I decided to integrate this three pieces of software together: 
- a. The Web content management system **WordPress**
- b. The User Interface software framework **React native** 
- c. Python-based web framework **Django** implemented as REST-API
